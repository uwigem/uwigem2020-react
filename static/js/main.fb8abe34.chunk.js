We attempt to direct the prokaryote Escherichia coli (domain Bacteria) to transfer DNA encoding potentially useful traits from to the yeast Saccharomyces cervisiae (domain Fungi). The design utilizes standard engineering and synthetic biology techniques to modularize this process, in order to enable usage across varying organisms and conditions. To achieve control over our system, bacteria transfer DNA via conjugation only if certain conditions are met. In our design, E. coli transfers the genes to metabolize lactose in S. cerevisiae, but only where lactose is prevalent, glucose is minimal, and yeast proximity is sensed via a yeast-produced signaling molecule. It therefore provides a means for conditional, not constitutive, gene transfer between diverse organisms. Applications might include the production of transgenic plants and animals, clinical gene delivery, and interacting multiple-organism systems.","awards":["Bronze Medal"],"medal":2},{"year":2009,"name":"Ideal Protein Purification","link":"http://2009.igem.org/Team:Washington","img":"https://i.ibb.co/TTfdc2k/2009.png","professor":"","description":"Our project, the Idealized Protein Purification (IPP) system, is an all-in-one protein expression and purification platform built on BioBrick standards that will reduce costs, save time, and simplify procedures associated with recombinant protein production.","details":"Recombinant, purified protein production is a decades-old technology that has revolutionized research in biotechnology and medicine.

Our project, the Idealized Protein Purification (IPP) system, is an all-in-one protein expression and purification platform built on BioBrick standards that will reduce costs, save time, and simplify procedures associated with recombinant protein production. The key to our IPP system is a novel combination of three subsystems: expression, secretion and display. We use E. coli bacteria that we have genetically modified to be a chassis for expressing your favorite protein, secreting it to the media, then binding and displaying the protein on the cell surface. At this point, collecting your favorite purified protein is as simple as pelleting and re-suspending a sufficient quantity of bacterial cells in an elution buffer. The speed and simplicity of our IPP system exhibits the utility of synthetic biology for developing new techniques that improve upon established practices.

To provide an inexpensive method for tuning gene expression with light, we developed a tablet application that is freely available.

To date, sensors that respond to red, green, and blue wavelengths of light have been reported. Light induced expression of genes has a number of advantages over chemical induction methods.  For example, light induced expression is cheaper than chemical methods, can be used to finely tune expression levels through modulations of intensity, and can be rapidly removed -- a feature lacking in chemical induction systems. Furthermore, many light expression systems are reversible, depending on the wavelength of light used.  Finally, the ability to control the expression levels of multiple genes of interest simultaneously could have far reaching implications for tuning biosynthetic pathways. The use of chemical inducers for this application would likely prove to be difficult and cost prohibitive, but multichromatic gene induction represents a potential solution to this problem. To this end, the 2013 University of Washington iGEM team chose to continue a project we began in 2012 that is aimed at the development and characterization of a set of tools that bring multichromatic gene expression into the realm of possibility for synthetic biologists.","awards":["Silver Medal"],"medal":1},{"year":2014,"name":"High Throughput Selection of Stable Protein Variants","link":"http://2014.igem.org/Team:Washington","img":"https://i.ibb.co/SmzjwQH/2014.jpg","professor":"","description":"Our team has developed a generalizable, high throughput method to select for the increased expression and stability of engineered proteins, making them more amenable to large-scale production in Escherichia coli and other downstream applications.","details":"Stabilizing proteins is an incredibly important and time consuming task in the field of protein engineering. Current methods require using intimate knowledge of the protein to hypothesize point mutations that could possibly improve stability. Extensive in vitro testing follows involving cloning the new construct into your model organism, expressing the construct, purifying your protein of interest, and producing a melting curve to verify if indeed your mutation did improve stability. In addition to being time intensive, this method is unreliably successful. Our team has developed a generalizable, high throughput method to select for the increased expression and stability of engineered proteins, making them more amenable to large-scale production in Escherichia coli and other downstream applications. Our method involves the insertion of proteins into a Gal4-VP16 transactivator that binds a promoter directly upstream of a GFP gene. The protein of interest is inserted into the middle of this complex using polypeptide linkers allowing for the subsequent selection of mutants associated with higher GFP output. We hypothesize that more stable proteins and their complexes will not be degraded by the cell\u2019s natural machinery which will allow the Gal4-VP16 construct to produce higher levels of GFP. Less stable proteins will be degraded through natural mechanisms and will not produce GFP. The difference between these two populations can be evaluated using Flow Cytometry or Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting.","awards":["Silver Medal"],"medal":1},{"year":2015,"name":"Lab on a Strip:  Developing a Novel Platform for Yeast Biosensors","link":"http://2015.igem.org/Team:Washington","img":"https://i.ibb.co/drQYhQY/2015.jpg","professor":"Eric Klavins","description":"We have developed a cheap diagnostic tool in which genetically-modified baker\u2019s yeast is grown on a paper device and is able to produce an easy-to-read color output in the presence of a target molecule.","details":"The Pacific Ocean is home to a wide range of marine life, including the food source of many filter-feeders, toxin-producing algae.

Biotoxins are also just generally difficult to detect; contrary to popular belief, algal blooms are not always the striking crimson of \u201cred tides.\u201d Thus, blooms may not be discovered until after a poisoned shellfish is found. The Washington State Department of Health and commercial shellfish farmers conduct periodic surveys of local beaches to catch contaminations early, but these methods are costly, time-consuming, and not always effective. This can especially pose a dilemma for individual shellfish hunters, who do not have the resources to screen their shellfish for toxins.

Our project utilizes the violacein pathway to simulate other metabolic pathways with colored signals. By regulating gene expression in this gene set with two different inducible promoters, we are able to yield up to four different color outputs.

Creating a CID system with desired affinity and specificity for any given small molecule remains an unsolved problem for computational design and other protein engineering approaches. To address this challenge, we have used a novel strategy to select CID binders from a vastly diverse combinatorial nanobody library. We have created new CID systems that can sense cholecalciferol and artemisinin.

Using molecule-specific nanobodies, we can design the two CID binders to attach to a wide variety of small molecules, even those that are challenging for conventional biosensors to detect. Through its specificity and ability to bind to small or hydrophobic molecules, the CID system overcomes problems that other biosensors face. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented an in vivo CID biosensor to detect the presence of cannabidiol.
